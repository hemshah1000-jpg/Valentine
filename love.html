<h1>You Said Yes 🥰</h1>

<p>
From the moment you came into my life, everything seemed brighter and more colorful.  
Your smile, your laugh, and the way you light up every room you walk into make even ordinary days feel extraordinary.  
Every little moment we’ve shared whether it’s a simple conversation, a silly joke, or just sitting in comfortable silence has left a mark on my heart that I can’t ignore.  

I never knew that someone could make me feel this way, that someone could make the world feel warmer just by being themselves.  
You inspire me to be better, to smile more, and to see the beauty in even the smallest things.  
I cherish every memory we’ve made and I can’t wait to make so many more with you.  

So today, I’m just going to ask a simple question in the simplest way: Will you be my Valentine?  
Because I can’t imagine a better person to share laughter, adventures, and quiet moments with than you.  
I hope this day is as special for you as you are for me, and I promise that no matter what, my feelings for you will always be full of warmth, care, and affection.  

Happy Advanced Valentine’s Day 💕 I hope this note makes you smile, blush, and maybe even feel a little spark of excitement because that’s exactly how you make me feel every single day.
